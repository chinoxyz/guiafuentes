Following is complete algorithm for finding longest distances.
1) Initialize dist[] = {NINF, NINF, ...} and dist[s] = 0 where s is the source vertex. Here NINF means negative infinite.
2) Create a toplogical order of all vertices.
3) Do following for every vertex u in topological order.
.....Do following for every adjacent vertex v of u
.......if (dist[v] < dist[u] + weight(u, v))
.........dist[v] = dist[u] + weight(u, v)
